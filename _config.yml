  I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. at the Institute of Economic Studies, Charles University, where my research interest is in the fields of renewable energy, green finance, climate change, and credit rating.  I am fluent in Chinese, and English and actively developing my language skills in Slovak.
  
  My research primarily revolves around two key areas of study:
  - Green finance
  - Credit rating
  - Financial market analysis: stock, bond pricing

  The coding knowledge I am most familar with are: <mark>R</mark>, <mark>Stata</mark>, and <mark>snowflake SQL</mark>. I am progressing myself with <mark> Python </mark>.
